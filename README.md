##This project is a simple lexical analyzer written in C that reads an input file and identifies different types of tokens such as keywords (e.g., int, if, return), operators (e.g., +, -, =, >), and identifiers (like variable names). The program scans the input file character by character, uses functions like isalpha() and isalnum() to detect valid words, and compares them with a list of predefined keywords. If a word doesnâ€™t match a keyword, it's treated as an identifier. The analyzer also detects single-character operators. This task helps in understanding how a compiler breaks source code into meaningful tokens during lexical analysis. The implementation was done using the GCC compiler and a VS Code.
